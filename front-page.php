                    Our users don't actually need to include widgets on the theme.
                    So we need to make sure we wrap it is around an if statement
                    and if there aren't any widgets, then the design still needs to look good.

                    In our theme. If there are widgets inside the front_page_sidebar then we want our theme
                    to use 9 and 3 columns. Otherwise we want the main posts to take up the whole 12.

                    is_active_sidebar() needs the ID of the registered sidebar. So this must match
                    what you wrote in functions.php
                -->
                <?php if( is_active_sidebar('front_page_sidebar') ): ?>
                    <div class="col-3">
                        <div id="frontSidebar">
                            <!--
                                To get the sidebar to actually show all the widgets, then say dynamic_sidebar(id)
                                This will then echo out all the widgets which you have specified in the widgets section.

                                By default they will be echoed out as li's but if you change the befores and afters then
                                it would use those instead.

                                The widgets will use default styles so they won't look good by default.
                                If you are allowing widgets, you will have to style them yourself in your css.
                                There is a way on only allowing specific widgets on your site which also might be useful
                                if you don't want to style every single widget.
