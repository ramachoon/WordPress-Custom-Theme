/*
    Custom post types are really important in wordpress.
    They allow us to create new types of post whcih we can then render them out on our page.
    Bellow we are creating a post type called staff. This will include all of the staff members of our company.

    For any bit of content the user needs to upload, it would be worth making a post type.
    Examples could be
        - Staff members
        - A second blog
        - Images for a image slider
        - A list of books of movies

        Often there could be two things name the same, especially if we use a plugin.
        The plugin we install might also include a post type called staff.
        This would then confuse our site about which one to use.
        Saying _x() we tell it that this name is unique to this theme to read it seperatly to other it might find.
        You need to say _x(text, 'information about the text', text domain which you set in your style.css)
