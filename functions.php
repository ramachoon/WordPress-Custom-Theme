    What we are doing bellow is adding our bootstrap styles into our theme.
    We can't do it the normal way which we have done in the past, but rather add it into the wp_head or wp_footer sections

    Whenever we work in the functions.php file, we need to create a function to tell it what to do
    and then tell wordpress what loading que do you want that function to be a part of.
    This one bellow is adding in our css and js into the scripts que which gets loaded when the page loads

    Adding menus into your theme.
    We want our users to be able to add in their own menus with links they define.
    We just need to register all the different menus which could appear on our site.
    Our users don't have the ability to register their own ones but use the ones which our theme allows,
    all that they can do is add new items into the menu.

    In our php files, we specify where the navigations go and style them to suit our theme.

    Bellow are two ways which you can get menus into your theme.
    The menus section is located under the Appearance tab and is unique to the current theme you have one.

    Bootstrap 4 styles menus differently than 3.
    In B4, it is the a tag which gets styles rather than the li's.
    This makes it difficult to style a menu to use bootstrap.
    Luckily the wordpress community is amazing and someone has created a file which will
    convert your menu into the bootstrap version easily.
