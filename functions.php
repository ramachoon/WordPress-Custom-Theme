    What we are doing bellow is adding our bootstrap styles into our theme.

    Whenever we work in the functions.php file, we need to create a function to tell it what to do
    and then tell wordpress what loading que do you want that function to be a part of.
    This one bellow is adding in our css and js into the scripts que which gets loaded when the page loads

        We just need to register all the different menus which could appear on our site.
        Our users don't have the ability to register their own ones but use the ones which our theme allows,
        all that they can do is add new items into the menu.

        In our php files, we specify where the navigations go and style them to suit our theme.

        Bellow are two ways which you can get menus into your theme.
        The menus section is located under the Appearance tab and is unique to the current theme you have one.

        posts pages. There is a list of post formats available in the codex. You need to
        specify which of the post formats you want to include in your site.
        From that we can create files which render out the content differently.

        Files to look at:
            - front-page.php
            - content.php
            - content-*.php

        The options in the array aren't required but give us more functionality to the uploading image.
        The width and the height give the aspect ratio of the image. Ideally we want to be able to
        crop it to the right dimentions for our theme.
        Flex width and height allow the user to move the cropping area to whatever they want.
        If it is false, then it would stick within the aspect ratio given.

        This section bellow is allowing us to have a custom header image in our theme.
        It will create a Header Image panel appear in the customizer.

        If we want there to be a default image, we need to register it before we actually call the image.

        This default image will only appear the very first time someone installs the theme.
        If you upload a new image and then delete it, the default WON'T be used.
        What the custom-header does is either gives you the ability to have a header image or not.
        So if you click the hide image button. Your default won't show because you are hiding the image.

        In your code (header-front.php), you need to decide if your theme must include
        a header image or not. It you don't mind, then you will have to wrap the entire div in
        a if( get_header_image() ). This will then hide the whole div if there isn't an image uploaded.
        If you want to make sure there is always a header, then you need to write an if statement
        to check if there is an image and if there is get the url, otherwise get the url of the default
        image you want to include.

    Sidebars are extra areas on your pages which users can add default wordpress

    on the side of pages. Techinally they could go anywhere on the site.

    Just like usual we have to turn on this functionality on our theme to be able to
    access the widgets section.

    First thing you need to do is register a sidebar.
    The register_sidebar() is for registering just 1 sidebar. If you want to add multiple
    you could either write the function twice, or use the register_sidebars() function.

    There is a range of parameters which you can give it and they will all use a default
    if you don't specify them. The main one we should be aware of is the id. Each sidebar
    needs a unique identifier for when we call it on the page.

    To see where the sidebar goes, look at front-page.php
