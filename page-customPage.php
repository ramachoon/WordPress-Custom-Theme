<!--
    page-$slug.php can be used to render out specific pages based on the slug of the page.
    The slug is the last part of the webpages URL, so if your page is site.com/about, then
    your slug would be about.
    The slug gets created based on the name of the page your user makes.
    You can manually change the slug inside of the wordpress
    dashboard if you would like.


    I would recommend not using this as you can't guarantee that the name of the page
    your user creates will match the file you made.
    If you developed it with page-about.php but your user makes a page called about-us
    then this file won't be rendered as it doesn't match.
